# Applied Data Science
This is a repository containing my classwork in Applied Data Science. In this class, we were introduced to advanced topics in machine learning, data science and industry techniques.


Final Project:

 Utilised various machine learning methods such as gradient boosting, random forest and ensemble learning to understand and predict customer churn in telco companies
 Provided recommendations on how to reduce customer churn based on quantitative analysis and real-world context
 Evaluated the effectiveness of models using the confusion matrix, the ROC curve, and the accuracy score after cross-validation,
with the best model achieving over 80% of accuracy
